# The Plan

What am I going to need to make?

- various games and worlds
- MDP code with proper interfaces
- 10-arm test harness...
- some interface for the world to interact
- various programming demos, like the racetrack thing

Do I need to bring some probabilistic programming ideas into the fold here? Maybe not at first, maybe that's too turbo?

Each of these needs to have its own visualization.

Can I go totally overboard and integrate this with a website where you can interact? Where you can actually have some way of playing the games, or setting the parameters?


## Probabilistic Programming

Does this help me at all? https://github.com/stripe/rainier/blob/develop/docs/tour.md

## Next Steps

- Get the graphs working... show that we can aggregate experience
across games, and get figure 2_2 working
- implement the different strategies and show off those graphs too
- lock down nice interfaces, get it all working well.
