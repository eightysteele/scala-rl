# WARNING!

Note - this is VERY EARLY DAYS! All of the files in the course with this warning are the raw, totally unprocessed notes that I generated during my first reading of "Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction".

I'll be converting these into proper course sections with wonderful embedded code that you can try out. I'm not there yet, but I wanted to develop all of this in the open.

Maybe you'll find these notes interesting, but don't expect anything special... yet!
