### <a id="course" href="#course"></a>What is the course?

I'll fill in more later - I'm writing these as placeholders.

### <a id="how" href="#how"></a>How can I use Reinforcement Learning?

Another placeholder!

### <a id="contributing" href="#contributing"></a>How can I help?

The ScalaRL community welcomes and encourages contributions! Here are a few ways to help out:

- Look at the [code coverage report](https://codecov.io/github/sritchie/scala-rl?branch=develop), find some untested code, and write a test for it. Even simple helper methods and syntax enrichment should be tested.
- Find an [open issue](https://github.com/sritchie/scala-rl/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue), leave a comment on it to let people know you are working on it, and submit a pull request.

See the [contributing guide]({{ site.baseurl }}/contributing.html) for more information.
