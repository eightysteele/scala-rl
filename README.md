Reinforcement Learning in Scala, the functional way.

I definitely don't need to go fully overboard... but the gold standard is to reimplement a bunch of this stuff:

in Scala.

## Notes

Can we write the update steps in some interesting way? Like, you have a function that you pass an action to, and eventually it returns some reward? I think so!

## Blog Series

This code supports the blog series on functional reinforcement learning.

## Get Involved

Want to contribute examples or use this stuff?

## Inspiration

## To File

- I'm using Rainier's version, but this is a nice article about the
probability Monad:
